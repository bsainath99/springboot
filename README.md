# Implementation of Spring Boot application

In this project, I have implemented Sprig Boot application. Implemented different layers like : Config, Controller, Entity, Error, Repository, Service
We used multiple layers for implementing the whole application and the work flow looks like : 
**User --> Controller --> Service --> DAO / Repository.**
