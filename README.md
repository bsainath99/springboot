# Implementation of Spring Boot application with all layers 

In this project, I have implemented Sprig Boot application. Implemented different layers like : Config, Controller, Entity, Error, Repository, Service
We used multiple layers for implementing the whole application and the work flow looks like : 
**User --> Controller --> Service --> DAO / Repository.**


The main objective of this is how an spring application application works. Also, focuses just backend on how the internal work flow of an application when it is running...
